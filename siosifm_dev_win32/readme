The development pack for the SIOS-RE-10 interferometer consists of the following
parts:

include:

directory with the include files.

lib:

directory with the dynamic link library


stdcall:

The "stdcall" directory contains the siosifm.dll compiled _stdcall as calling convention.

It allows to use the siosifm.dll in VisualBasic6.


mathlab:

Example how to use the DLL in MathLab


examples/example1

A simple example application in text mode. It shows the very basic operations:
opening and closing of the interface, opening and closing of devices,
how to get measurement values.


examples/example2

A more complex GUI application. The application was written in Qt. But even
without knowledge of Qt the handling of the SIOSIFM-API should be clear visible.


examples/example3

Like example1 this is a small text mode application. It shows the usage of the angle
calculation for two and three beam interferometers.


examples/example4

Like example1 it is a simple console application. It demonstrates the usage of PSD (lateral
shift sensor) values with interferometer containing the optional PSD-04 card(s).


examples/common

contains the include files, the three examples are compiled with. The same as
in "include".


siosifm.pdf

contains the documentation of the API
