siosifm.dll is made with the free MinGW-GNU compiler. 

Unfortunately Microsoft removes the tool to import DLLs from other
compilers with VisualStudio 32-bit. We provide an import lib without
any support as it is. The recent import lib is based on DL version 1.4.0
Newer functions may not be contained.



The Knowlagdebase article 

 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/131313/en-us

describes how to make import libs by yourself.

In summary the following steps are necessary:


 * Launch : DUMPBIN /EXPORTS siosifm.DLL siosifm.txt

 * Create a siosifm.def file (text editor) and copy the function names
from the "name"-column of the siosifm.txt (created in the last step) into
the exports-section 

A sample of the siosifm.def file may look like:


LIBRARY   SIOSIFM
EXPORTS
   IfmInit   @1
   IfmOpenUSB   @2
   IfmCloseDevice   @3
   IfmClose   @4


The ordinal numbers (@...) are optional.

* Launch: LIB /DEF:siosifm.def

creates the required siosifm.lib
